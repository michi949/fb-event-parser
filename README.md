### Using

After installed the extension, open now some Facebook events. Then click in the extension on parse and it will parse every open facebook event site!

You may not get every event, because facebook use alot of tags. So it is difficult to parse every HTML Tag. Also they may change the tags after times. 

### Prerequisites

For new Tags change the tags here!

```
 document.getElementById("seo_h1_tag").innerText;
```


## Running the tests

After loading try to build and run it!
